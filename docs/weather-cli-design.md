# Weather CLI Tool Design Document

## Overview

A command-line interface tool that provides weather reports for specified locations.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Accept location input (city name or zipcode)
- [ ] Display current weather conditions
- [ ] Show basic metrics (temperature, humidity, conditions)
- [ ] Provide hourly forecast for next 24 hours
- [ ] Provide extended forecast for next 7 days

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] Python-based CLI implementation
- [ ] Weather data from public API
- [ ] Error handling for invalid locations
- [ ] Configuration file support

## Implementation Plan

1. Research and select weather API
2. Design CLI interface and commands
3. Implement core functionality
4. Add error handling
5. Add configuration options

## Open Questions

- Which weather API service should we use?
- Should we support batch queries?
- How should we handle API rate limits?

## Notes

Add implementation notes and decisions here as we progress
