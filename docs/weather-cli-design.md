# Weather CLI Tool Design Document

## Overview

A command-line interface tool that provides weather reports for specified locations.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Accept location input (city name or zipcode)
- [ ] Display current weather conditions
- [ ] Show basic metrics (temperature, humidity, conditions)
- [ ] Provide hourly forecast for next 24 hours
- [ ] Provide extended forecast for next 7 days

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] Python-based CLI implementation
- [ ] Weather data from public API
- [ ] Error handling for invalid locations
- [ ] Configuration file support

## Implementation Plan

1. Research and select weather API
2. Design CLI interface and commands
3. Implement core functionality
4. Add error handling
5. Add configuration options

## Open Questions

- Which weather API service should we use?
- Should we support batch queries?
- How should we handle API rate limits?

## Notes

### API Selection

- Selected OpenWeatherMap API with `pyowm` Python package
- Reasons for selection:
  - Official Python package available
  - Free tier supports 60 calls/minute
  - Provides all required weather data (current, hourly, 7-day forecast)
  - Large community and good documentation
  - Built-in error handling

#### Alternatives Considered

1. WeatherAPI.com
   - Good documentation and reliability
   - Python wrapper libraries available but not official
   - Free tier limited to 1M calls/month
   - Rejected due to less mature Python ecosystem

2. Tomorrow.io (formerly ClimaCell)
   - Modern API with Python SDK
   - High accuracy data
   - More complex integration
   - Rejected due to higher pricing and overcomplicated for our needs
