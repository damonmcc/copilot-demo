# Weather CLI Tool Design Document

## Overview

A command-line interface tool that provides weather reports for specified locations.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- [ ] Accept location input (city name or zipcode)
- [ ] Display current weather conditions
- [ ] Show basic metrics (temperature, humidity, conditions)
- [ ] Provide hourly forecast for next 24 hours
- [ ] Provide extended forecast for next 7 days

### Technical Requirements

- [ ] Python-based CLI implementation
- [ ] Weather data from public API
- [ ] Error handling for invalid locations
- [ ] Configuration file support

## Implementation Plan

1. Research and select weather API
2. Design CLI interface and commands
3. Implement core functionality
4. Add error handling
5. Add configuration options

## Open Questions

- Which weather API service should we use?
- Should we support batch queries?
- How should we handle API rate limits?

## Notes

### API Selection

- Selected Open-Meteo API with `openmeteo-requests` Python package
- Reasons for selection:
  - Free tier with no API key required
  - No rate limiting
  - Historical weather data from 1940 onwards
  - Modern API with excellent Python support
  - Efficient data transfer using FlatBuffers format
  - Built-in support for NumPy, Pandas, and Polars
  - Active open-source development
  - Large and growing community

#### Alternatives Considered

1. OpenWeatherMap
   - Large established user base
   - Official Python package (`pyowm`) available
   - Free tier limited to 60 calls/minute
   - Historical data requires paid subscription
   - Rejected due to API key requirement and rate limits

2. WeatherAPI.com
   - Good documentation and reliability
   - Python wrapper libraries available but not official
   - Free tier limited to 1M calls/month
   - Rejected due to less mature Python ecosystem

3. Tomorrow.io (formerly ClimaCell)
   - Modern API with Python SDK
   - High accuracy data
   - More complex integration
   - Rejected due to higher pricing and overcomplicated for our needs
