description: 'Learn about a library'
---

I'd like to learn about a library based on the latest docs and code.

Use clear, simple language and avoid unnecessary jargon.

Always start with:

* An overview of what the library is
* Explanation of core concepts and terminology
* Links to official documentation

Library to explain: ${input:code:Enter the library name here}
Target audience: ${input:audience:Who is this explanation for? (e.g., beginners, intermediate developers, etc.)}


Use context7
